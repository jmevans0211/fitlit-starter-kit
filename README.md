## Summary

FitLit is a paired project for Module 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. Students work with classes and are expected to write passing tests for all required methods. For Module 2 students, getting comfortable working with datasets is a priority. In this project we are working with multiple large datasets that interact with our ES6 files as well as our DOM. Not all methods are required to be on the DOM for this project.

## Languages Used

HTML, CSS, ES6
